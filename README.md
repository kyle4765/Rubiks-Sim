# Rubiks-Sim
This is a program meant to simulate and perhaps one day solve a Rubik's cube
This is the readme file

In spite of bernie, i would like to separate my classes into a class for the cube object iteself and the turns, a class for the graphics and drawing the cube, a class for advanced actions and inputs, a class for automated solving and such, and maybe others
